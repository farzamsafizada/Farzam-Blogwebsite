      <h3>5 Tips to Learn HTML Faster and What is HTML?</h3>
      <p class="date">October 31, 2025</p>
      <p>HTML is the backbone of web development. Here are 5 tips to master it quickly...</p>
      <button onclick="readMore('post1')">Read More</button>
      <div id="post1" class="more-text">
        <p>Tip 1: Practice daily. Tip 2: Build a personal website. Tip 3: Learn by doing. Tip 4: Study others’ code. Tip 5: Never stop exploring!<br>
        <br> What is HTML?<br>
             HTML is called a markup language because it is used to structure and
             present content on the web, not to perform logic or computations like<br>
             programming languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, C#).<br>
             Unlike programming languages, HTML:<br> 
          • Lacks logic: No variables, loops, or conditional statements.<br>
          • Defines structure: Uses tags to format and organize content rather
            than executing commands. <br>
          • Depends on other technologies: Needs CSS for styling and JavaScript
           for interactivity

      <h3>How to Start Learning JavaScript</h3>
      <p class="date">October 30, 2025</p>
      <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. In this post, we’ll learn how to start coding with JS...</p>

        <p>
             You can start learning JavaScript by practicing small code snippets daily. Try building simple things like calculators or to-do lists!
            And you should know What is a Variable?<br>
         • Variables act as containers that store data values.<br>
         • They allow you to save information, reassign new values, and reuse code<br>
            more efficiently.<br>
            Declaration Methods:<br>
         • var: Older declaration syntax with function scope.<br>
         • let: Modern variable declaration with block scope.<br>
         • const: Declares constants; once assigned, cannot be re-assigned.<br>
            Tip: Use let and const in new projects to reduce common errors associated<br>
            with variable hoisting and scope issues.<br>

        <p> Definition: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used <br>
            for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.  <br>
            • Purpose: Separates content from presentation, allowing <br>
              consistent design and easier maintenance.<br>
            • Benefits:<br>
            • Enhances web design and user experience<br>
            • Enables responsive design and dynamic effects<br>
            • Simplifies changes across multiple web pages</p>

        <p>A JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.<br>
           • Focuses on creating reusable UI components and efficiently updating the DOM through its Virtual DOM.<br>
             Advantages of Using React:<br>
           • Declarative: Write predictable UI components by describing what you want to see on the screen.<br>
           • Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to<br>
             make complex interfaces.<br>
           • Virtual DOM: Enhances performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulation.<br>
           • Reusable Code: Components can be reused across multiple parts of the application, which speeds up<br>
             development.<br>
           • Large Ecosystem: Supported by an extensive community, robust tooling, additional libraries (like React<br>
             Router, Redux, etc.), and comprehensive documentation.<br>
           • Cross-Platform Development: With React Native, you can build native mobile applications using the same<br>
             concepts.</p>
